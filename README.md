# My Portfolio Website
My first time truly building a website from the ground up. Open to and interested in feedback, 
I'm sure there is plenty of opportunity to improve!

## Shorter term goals with the site
- [ ] Fully complete landing page + landing content
- [ ] Build out individual pages for portfolio highlights
- [ ] Ensure links and contact forms in working order
- [ ] Publish first working version, most likely with Heroku

## Longer term
I plan to continue to maintain, update my shared content, and upgrade the site as I gain more skills and have different projects I would like to share.
